# Plan

Implementation Nodes
We'd need to modify your LangGraph to have:

- questionExpansion node - generates the 2 additional questions
- multiRetrieval node - retrieves docs for all 3 questions
- combineResults node - merges and deduplicates
- generate node - (existing, but enhanced with richer context)

- Uses Gemini
- Portable - completely standalone function that doesn't modify existing workflow. also create test for it.
